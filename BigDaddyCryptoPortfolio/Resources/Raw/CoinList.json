    "Description": "What is CUDOS? \r\nCUDOS powers a decentralised compute network that will interoperate with multiple blockchain ecosystems to provide the following benefits:\r\n\r\n1. Trusted layer 1 validator network built on the Tendermint protocol - Wasm compatibility, for smart contracts to be deployed on CUDOS using next-generation languages so long as they compile to WebAssembly. I.e. Golang, Rust, Java etc.\r\n\r\n2. Cross-chain or Horizontal interoperability thanks to the network\u2019s Inter Blockchain Communication (IBC) integration, allowing Cudos Network smart contracts to interface with multiple networks.\r\n\r\n3. 10x lower transaction and gas costs compared to those on PoW networks - A massively scalable network to facilitate more sophisticated smart contract operations\r\n\r\n4. Higher performance with anywhere between 200 to 500 Peak TPS on the network - access to a globally distributed layer 3 network of secure cloud, and compute, resources\r\n\r\nTuring complete solutions for non-Turing complete Layer 1 blockchain networks. With the underlying Cudo platform live in over 145 countries, across enterprise and edge environments, and used by over 250,000 users, CUDOS is the next major release, providing a decentralised computing layer bridging on-chain and off-chain resources.\r\n\r\nThe CUDOS token serves the following clear purposes: Transaction payments, Network governance and operations, a staking mechanism for receiving blockchain and cloud workloads, and a medium of exchange (MoE). \r\n\r\nWhat is CUDOS trying to solve? \r\nScaling on blockchain is both expensive and limited in the type of use-cases it can support. CUDOS solves this issue by providing a highly scalable Layer 2 and 3 solution, connecting both on-chain and off-chain consumers to the network via smart contracts and APIs. \r\n\r\nWho are the founders at CUDOS?\r\nCUDOS was founded by Mathew Hawkins, an award-winning entrepreneur, who previously founded C4L, a data center, cloud and network infrastructure provider that grew to support 1% of the UK\u2019s internet infrastructure. Exiting in 2016 for $30m, Mathew started Cudo and the CUDOS network to build infrastructure services in software, what he previously achieved in hardware. The executive team have backgrounds in building and scaling and SaaS with COO Lee Woodham, who has over 25 years split across scaling financial services and tech companies. The board of advisors also includes David Juxon, former MD of Bank of America, Chris Deering, Former President of Sony Entertainment (Playstation), Joerg Roskowetz, Director of Blockchain for AMD and Maggie Fang, early investor in Uber and Alibaba. \r\n\r\nWhat makes CUDOS unique? \r\nCUDOS is the first decentralised computing network to provide services to both on-chain and off-chain infrastructure consumers. Built on the Cosmos blockchain and utilising the Tendermint protocol for secure BFT consensus, the CUDOS validator network will provide a globally distributed and highly secure network able to allocate more intensive workloads out to the underlying Layer 3 Cudo platform. \r\n\r\nHow is the CUDOS network secured? \r\nThe CUDOS Network utilises the Byzantine Fault Tolerant Bonded Proof of Stake mechanism featured in the Cosmos SDK, known as Tendermint Core, as its consensus engine. Validators in the CUDOS network stake a given amount of CUDOS in order to earn fees from validating transactions on the network in a secure and highly reliable way. In order to achieve this, the CUDOS Network also leverages the Cosmos SDK\u2019s staking, slashing, and governance modules to incentivise a minimum of 95% uptime and to swiftly eliminate validators known to perform double-signs or other known forms of bad actor behaviours. \r\n\r\nWho are the major partners of CUDOS?\r\nCUDOS is partnered with major and recognised brands across both blockchain and enterprise computing verticals, including AMD, Ultra \u0026 Algorand. Strategic backers include Outlier Ventures (OV), Moonwhale, Moonrock, Brilliance Ventures, GBV, Spincrypto, Double Peak, Coinvision, and BMW Capital. \r\n\r\nHow many CUDOS coins are there in circulation?\r\nThere is a maximum supply of 10 billion CUDOS tokens released over a 10 year period (starting from the 11th January 2021). The total supply of 10 billion CUDOS is distributed via multiple allocations, with 34% Ecosystem \u0026 Community Development, 33.78% Reserve, 20% Team (2% released based per milestone achieved. 10 key pre-determined milestones), 5% Advisors and 7.22% to presale token holders. Use of funds will be as follows: 30% Research \u0026 Product Development, 10% Administration \u0026 Operations, 20% marketing, 10% CUDOS Validator Nodes (CVN), 13% User Acquisition, 10% Community Engagement and 7% Contingency. \r\n\r\nWhere can you buy CUDOS?\r\nAt the time of writing, the top exchanges for CUDOS trading are Ascendex, KuCoin, Gate.io, Uniswap, Bittrex Poloniex, CoinField, Liquid, ZT Global, and others.",

    "Description": "SingularityNET is a decentralized marketplace for Artificial Intelligence (AI). The business value of AI is becoming clearer each day; however, there\u2019s a significant gap between the people developing AI tools (researchers and academics) and the businesses that want to use them. Most organizations need a more customized solution than what a single AI project can offer, and research projects oftentimes have trouble accessing a large enough data set to build effective machine learning. SingularityNET closes these gaps.\r\n\r\nThe long-term vision of the SingulairtyNET team is to build a network of complex AI Agent interactions primarily using resources from the OpenCog Foundation. To look at this further, let\u2019s check out their in-house built humanoid robot, Sophia. Sophia uses a combination of AI Agents that range from natural language processing to physical motor controls to operate. You tell Sophia to summarize a video that\u2019s embedded in a webpage. To do this, Sophia sends a request to Agent A. Through its AI, Agent A knows that Agent B specializes in analyzing and transcribing video while Agent C specializes in summarizing text. Agent A pays Agent B and Agent C to perform these tasks while Sophia pays Agent A to coordinate. All the while, each Agent has updated their own AI with the network information gained from these tasks and combines it with their previous experiences and knowledge. Therefore, the collective AI of the system grows at a faster rate than any individual Agent.\r\n\r\nSingularityNET wants to build a decentralized protocol for creators and users of AI to interact with each other, to not only help individual projects benefit by leveraging the strengths of other AI systems that might handle certain tasks better, but ultimately to develop SingularityNET into a functioning AI system itself, with nodes on the network making their own decisions about how to connect services and proactively provide solutions to academic and business problems. Tokenizing the network creates an AI marketplace where AI developers and sellers can not only link with others who might assist in building more robust AI solutions, but also allow AI services and products to be bought and sold, creating revenue and establishing price points where none have existed before.\r\n\r\nThe SingularityNET team boasts 50\u002B AI developers and 10\u002B PhDs. Dr. Ben Goertzel leads the group as CEO and Chief Scientist. He\u2019s also the Chairman of the OpenCog Foundation and the Artificial General Intelligence Society, as well as the Chief Scientist at Hanson Robotics, the partner company helping bring SingularityNET to life. Dr. David Hanson, founder of Hanson Robotics, serves as the Robotics Lead. Most famously, Hanson Robotics built Sophia, the most expressive humanoid robot to date. Sophia is also a proud member of the SingularityNET team. The team recently released the alpha version of the platform and is planning on launching a public beta sometime in the middle of 2018.",

Clinical trial processes are notoriously costly and inefficient. They take many years, and involve increasing amounts of systems and data. The result is a lack of oversight, and uncertainty the integrity and authenticity of collected research data. It all drives the costs and reduces safety and reliability in the development of new medicines.\r\n\r\nSince early 2018, Triall has been working with clinical trial professionals to target these issues. Triall has developed software solutions that are integrated with blockchain technology. These solutions make clinical trials tamper-resistant, and enable secure integrations between the many isolated systems and parties involved in clinical trials. Hence, they promise to shape the world\u2019s first digital ecosystem for clinical trials.\r\n\r\nTriall\u2019s blockchain functionalities and ecosystem approach are unique in the 200-billion-dollar clinical trial industry. The project directly answers to growing calls for system interoperability and data traceability as voiced by regulators such as the FDA and EMA, and by a growing body of clinical trial professionals around the world. The project introduces a two-token system that functions as the ecosystem\u2019s primary means of payment, while also facilitating community engagement, governance, and token lock-up incentives.",

We are not perfect but we are getting better.\r\n\r\nThe Matrix 1.0 blockchain platform is the first AI-optimised blockchain platform. Low transaction speeds, lack of security, the complexity of usage, and squandered resources are four key concerns in blockchain that we address with AI technology. We built a public blockchain platform that is both functional and reliable.\r\n\r\nThe Matrix 2.0 constructs a blockchain-based AI economy based on data, computer power, and AI models. We\u0027re building a self-evolving AI platform with aggregated processing power, safe data management, transparent data sharing, and access to an ever-growing set of on-chain AI data, models, and applications.\r\n\r\nWe are now at Matrix 3.0, which we blend neuroscience with AI and Blockchain. This is very rare in the blockchain space, and the closet one is NeuraLink driven by Elon Musk. We use EEG or brain signal for Avatar Intelligence (AvI). AvI aims to realize the scenario imagined by the Matrix films where human brain is uploaded to the Internet, or where a program identical to a user\u0027s brain is created on the Internet. This means everyone will have his/her own digital avatar in the Metaverse. This avatar can be used to live life and do various tasks in the Metaverse under users\u0027 authorisation. It covers 4 phases, and we are on the journey of the 1st phase.\r\n\r\nInto the Matrix.",

    "Description": "iExec is an open-source, decentralized cloud computing platform, running on \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\u0022\u003EEthereum\u003C/a\u003E blockchain. iExec allows decentralized applications (dApps) an on-demand access to computing resources and technologies on iExec cloud. iExec has built a blockchain network where dApps can take advantage of cost effective and high-performance resources such as servers, databases, SaaS applications, web hosting and computer farms. iExec\u2019s native cryptocurrency \u2014 The RLC token is the primary asset used to access services in iExec infrastructure. RLC is short for \u201CRun on Lots of Computers.\u201D\r\n\r\niExec is headquartered at Lyon, France. It was founded by Gilles Fedak and Haiwu He, both are serving as Chief Executive Officer and Head of Asian-Pacific Region of iExec, respectively. Oleg Lodygensky is the Chief Technical Officer. Gilles Fedak received his PhD from the University of Paris Sud in 2003, and has been working as INRIA (Inventeurs du Monde Numerique) research scientist at ENS in Lyon, France. Similarly, Haiwu completed his M.Sc. and PhD from the University of Sciences and Technologies of Lille, France. On April 19, 2017, iExec launched its token sale and raised more than $12 million in exchange for 86,999,784 RLC.\r\n\r\nIn order to support dApps, smart contracts, and their platforms, iExec takes processing-intensive computations off-chain so as to keep a blockchain\u2019s on-chain functions running smoothly. To do this, iExec makes use of XtremWeb-HEP, an open-sourced Desktop Grid Software.  Desktop Grid computing (also known as Volunteer Computing) pools unused computing resources to be used by applications and platforms, and according to iExec\u2019s whitepaper, XtremWeb-HEP \u201Cimplements all the needed features\u201D to make this possible on a global scale, including \u201Cfault-tolerance, multi-applications, multi-users, hybrid public/private infrastructure, deployment of virtual images, data management, security and accountability, and many more.\u201D Essentially, with this software, dApps can utilize any computing resource in the iExec framework to run their programs.\r\n\r\nIn their whitepaper, the iExec team lays out the project\u2019s competitive landscape and explains these competitors in relation to iExec. They\u2019re quick to note that decentralized cloud storage providers like \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/filecoin\u0022\u003EFilecoin\u003C/a\u003E, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/storj\u0022\u003EStorj\u003C/a\u003E, and \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/siacoin\u0022\u003ESiacoin\u003C/a\u003E are not direct competitors, and it\u2019s easy to see why.  While iExec could theoretically take a step in this direction as it matures, it\u2019s not a storage platform; it\u2019s a computing platform. This does put it in competition with other decentralized computing protocols like \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/golem\u0022\u003EGolem\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/golem\u0022\u003ESONM\u003C/a\u003E. Both of these, however, are taking aim at a different animal.  Essentially, they\u2019re both building a decentralized supercomputer on blockchain technology, while iExec is targeting dApp development and sustainability.  Both look towards a future of a blockchain-powered, decentralized internet, but their functions, while sometimes similar, are more complementary than conflicting.",

    "Description": "Cortex is built on a new public chain called Cortex. The chain includes AI algorithms that support smart contracts, which means anyone can use Cortex to add AI to their smart contracts. It also creates an incentive mechanism for collective collaboration, allowing anyone to submit and optimize models in Cortex, while model contributors can also be rewarded. The end result of Cortex, according to the whitepaper, is the creation of \u201Cartificial general intelligence\u201D, or AGI, \u201Cbeing born on the Cortex\u201D. Cortex completed a private token sale in February/March 2018 for its CTXC tokens. That funding round was led by Bitmain and FBG Capital, among other well-known investors in the cryptocurrency space.\r\n\r\nPlacing artificial intelligence systems on the blockchain isn\u2019t a straightforward process. However, Cortex will solve this problem by allowing machine learning researchers around the world to upload well-trained corresponding data models to the storage layer of the Cortex public chain. Other users who need these AI models can make inferences using the models, then pay the person who developed those models. At each inference, a full node synchronizes the model and the data from the storage tier to the local site. Making an inference using Cortex\u2019s unique virtual machine, or CVM, will synchronize the results to the whole network and then return the result. Every time a user initiates a transaction on the Cortex, opens a smart contract, or performs an intelligence inference, the user will need to pay a certain number of \u201CEndorphin\u201D tokens.\r\n\r\nEndorphin is the pricing unit for transactions on Cortex. However, the platform will have two tokens, including Endorphins and Cortex Coins (CTXC). The overall goal of Cortex is to provide state-of-the-art machine learning models on the blockchain where users can infer using smart contracts. Cortex also seeks to create a machine learning platform where users can post tasks on the platform or submit artificial intelligence-based decentralized apps.\r\n\r\nCortex\u2019s token sale began with a single private placement round. That round took place from February 7 to March 7, 2018, during which tokens were sold at a price of 1 ETH = 1500 CTXC. In March 2018, the company announced that it had reached its target cap of 40,000 ETH for 60 million CTXC, or 20.01% of the total token distribution. FBG Capital and Bitmain were lead investors during the token sale. CTXC tokens are ERC20 tokens on the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\u0022\u003EEthereum\u003C/a\u003E blockchain. There\u2019s a total supply of 299,792,458 tokens. Of the total supply, 50.03% (150 million) are reserved for Cortex coin miners as a mining reward, 24.95% (74,792,458) are dedicated to the project\u2019s foundation from the genesis block (including 15.01% to the Cortex Lab, 9.01% to project marketing, and 0.93% to challenge bounties), with the remaining 5% going to advisors, academia, and the community from the genesis block.\r\nCortex aims to place advanced artificial intelligence systems on the blockchain. The company recently completed a private investment round during its token sale for CTXC tokens in February/March 2018. The next step is to roll out the Cortex public chain. Key features of the platform include its smart AI contracts and its Cortex Virtual Machine, both of which allow for advanced AI-based smart contract programming.",

The idea was to produce a means of exchange, independent of any central authority, that could be transferred electronically in a secure, verifiable and immutable way. It is a decentralized peer-to-peer internet currency making mobile payment easy, very low transaction fees, protects your identity, and it works anywhere all the time with no central authority and banks.\r\n\r\nBitcoin is designed to have only 21 million BTC ever created, thus making it a deflationary currency.

Our improvement over \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\u0022\u003EBitcoin\u003C/a\u003E is the addition of privacy. Zcash uses advanced cryptographic techniques, namely zero-knowledge proofs, to guarantee the validity of transactions without revealing additional information about them.\r\n\r\nHow Zcash works\r\n\r\nZcash encrypts the contents of shielded transactions. Since the payment information is encrypted, the protocol uses a novel cryptographic method to verify their validity.\r\n\r\nZcash uses a zero-knowledge proof construction called a zk-SNARK, developed by our team of experienced cryptographers based on recent breakthroughs in cryptography. These constructions allow the network to maintain a secure ledger of balances without disclosing the parties or amounts involved. Instead of publicly demonstrating spend-authority and transaction values, the transaction metadata is encrypted and zk-SNARKs are used to prove that nobody is cheating or stealing.\r\n\r\nZcash also enables users to send public payments which work similarly to Bitcoin. With the support for both shielded and transparent addresses, users can choose to send Zcash privately or publicly. Zcash payments sent from a shielded address to a transparent address reveal the received balance, while payments from a transparent address to a shielded address protect the receiving value. \r\n\r\nCheck out \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.coinbureau.com/education/what-is-zcash/\u0022\u003ECoinBureau\u003C/a\u003E for guide on What is ZCash.",

At the end of the token sale on May 25, 2017, the company had raised about $30 million. Storj Labs allowed SJCX holders to exchange their tokens with the new ones in a 1:1 ratio through a token conversion campaign which lasted till October 2017.\r\n\r\nStorj Labs pre-mined its entire supply of tokens at the inception; no new tokens can be created via STORJ mining. Nevertheless, users can obtain STORJ tokens by becoming a farmer in the network. Another obvious way to acquire STORJ is through trading on a cryptocurrency exchange. Up until now, cloud storage companies have dictated the terms of service to their users, and as a result, there has been little to no competition within this digital sector. However, with the introduction of Storj, all of that may change.\u0022\r\n\r\nCheck out \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.coinbureau.com/review/storj/\u0022\u003ECoinBureau\u003C/a\u003E for the full review on OmiseGo.",

This model forces all projects to share the same infrastructure, leading to congestion, increased transactions fees, and stifled growth. \r\n\r\nWhereas other blockchain platforms employ a single, shared-blockchain model, Komodo\u2019s federated multi-chain architecture provides each and every external project with independent infrastructure and a dedicated blockchain. \r\n\r\nThis multi-chain design is what makes Komodo unique among blockchain platforms. Each project is given the opportunity to create their own blockchain ecosystem via Komodo\u2019s infinitely scalable infrastructure. \r\n\r\nKomodo\u2019s tech enables seamless cross-chain interoperability among all federated blockchains. Every blockchain built with Komodo is also connected to 95% of chains outside the federation via atomic swap technology. Future plans are in place for blockchain bridging support, which will create cross-chain fungibility throughout the entire blockchains industry. \r\n\r\nMoreover, with Komodo\u2019s architecture, multiple blockchains can sync up and function as a single chain. If one chain is not meeting performance needs, additional chains can be added to form a blockchain cluster. A blockchain cluster boosts performance linearly without inflating coin supply or devaluing the currency. \r\n\r\nThe Komodo ecosystem is not only scalable and interoperable, it\u2019s also secured with the power of the Bitcoin network. This is accomplished with a series of cross-chain notarizations that store a blockhash onto the Bitcoin ledger every ten minutes, providing protection from 51% attacks. \r\n\r\nJoin Komodo as we continue to accelerate the global adoption of blockchain technology.

By optimizing storage solutions with its AI-based pipeline, ColdStack provides users with the most cost-efficient and secure way to store their files. ColdStack approach is transparent, immutable, and cryptographically verifiable. The platform provides simple and seamless integration of all the Decentralized Data Storages in one platform. There will also be no need for data migration needed to switch between various Decentralized Clouds.\r\n\r\nColdStack features a unified Amazon S3 compatible API which allows users to easily access decentralized storage solutions. By utilizing the $CLS token, users gain access to nearly any decentralized storage, and are no longer required to research the particular strengths of each service in addition to comparing costs. With our implementation of Amazon S3 API compatibility, we also allow individuals to access these services through an interface they are already familiar with, further streamlining a user\u2019s experience. Users can also access a wide range of file permissions and curate their experience based on their data storage needs. The unified API will create easy data storage and retrieval that will be possible from anywhere and anytime.\r\n\r\nNFTs also add another layer of complexity and fragmentation to decentralized storages, as these must also be stored on their respective networks and marketplaces. The platform has NFT support allowing users to tokneize any uploaded file in ERC-721 and ERC-1155 standards. As it currently stands, the ColdStack platform will be the only way a user can store bulk data with Filecoin, 4k photos with Storj, webpages with Arweave, and list NFTs with OpenSea and Rarible, all with one token.\u0022",

Before storing the data, the data is encrypted into many pieces and uploaded to different hosts. \r\n\r\nSiacoin is created by David Vorick and Luke Champine of Nebulous Inc. As the traditional storage platforms are higher in cost, more expensive and data is not well protected. Siacoin promises to offer secured storage transactions with smart contracts which is more affordable and reliable. Moreover, it is completely open source which means many individuals have contributed to Siacoin\u2019s software hence there will be an active community building innovative applications on top if the Sia API. \r\n\r\nIn 2018, Siacoin aims to introduce file sharing and be the go-to cloud storage platform for companies. Their goal is divided into 3 time frames which are short-term, medium-term and long-term development. Short-term development focuses on file sharing between Sia users. This allows Sia users to share files in the platform without having to take it off the cloud while increasing network utilization. Medium-term development\u2019s goal is to enhance partnerships. This means reaching out to large companies like Netflix and Dropbox to hopefully be able to be their storage and distribution framework.

    "Description": "The Livepeer project aims to deliver a live video streaming network protocol that is fully decentralized, highly scalable, crypto token incentivized, and results in a solution which can serve as the live media layer in the decentralized development (web3) stack. In addition, Livepeer is meant to provide an economically efficient alternative to centralized broadcasting solutions for any existing broadcaster. In this document we describe the Livepeer Protocol - a delegated stake based protocol for incentivizing participants in a live video broadcast network in a game-theoretically secure way. We present solutions for the scalable verification of decentralized work, as well as the prevention of useless work in an attempt to game the token allocations in an inflationary system.\r\n\r\nThe Livepeer Token (LPT) is the protocol token of the Livepeer network. But it is not the medium of exchange token. Broadcasters use Ethereum\u0027s Ether (ETH) to broadcast video on the network. Nodes who contribute processing and bandwidth earn ETH in the form of fees from broadcasters. LPT is a staking token that participants who want to perform work on the network stake in order to coordinate how work gets distributed on the network, and to provide security that the work will get done honestly and correctly. LPT has the following purposes:\r\n\r\nIt serves as a bonding mechanism in a delegated proof of stake system, in which stake is delegated towards transcoders (or validators) who participate in the protocol to transcode video and validate work. The token, and potential slashing that occurs due to protocol violation, is necessary in order to secure the network against a number of attacks. More below.\r\nIt routes work through the network in proportion to the amount of staked and delegated token, essentially serving as a coordination mechanism.\r\n\r\nIt is a unit of account that is specific to the Livepeer ecosystem, which forms the basis of a SectorCoin concept, applicable to additional functionality to be introduced in the future. Services such as DVR, closed captioning, ad insertion/monetization, and analytics can all plug into the Livepeer ecosystem and potentially make use of the security provided by staking LPT.\r\n\r\nAn initial allocation of Livepeer Token will be distributed so that stakeholders can fulfill various roles in, and use the network, and then additional token will be issued according to algorithmically programmed issuance over time.\r\n\r\nFollowing the conventions of Ethereum and many popular ERC20 tokens, LPT will be divisible by 10 ^ 18, with larger denominations such as the LPT itself intended to be used for user level transactions such as staking, and smaller denominations intended to be used for protocol accounting.",

SelfKey is a self-sovereign identity system that is based on the blockchain and can provide control and management of digital identities to users. Additionally, users can utilize SelfKey to securely manage a crypto portfolio and instantly onboard immigration, cryptocurrency, and financial services. One of the unique aspects of SelfKey is its ability to work as an all-in-one identity solution for self-sovereignty. SelfKey utilizes a novel approach to identity management while also resolving the issues related to existing centralized identity management systems. These include the lack of accessibility to financial services and the tedious KYC processes that are paper based.\r\n\r\nOne of the standout features of SelfKey is the self-hosted data storage. This lets you secure your identity documents and assets locally, so there is no risk of a major data breach as with other similar systems. The KYC processes within SelfKey also stand out for their efficiency. Qualified certifiers can provide you with reusable identity authentication upon request. You can then share this authentication multiple times with several service providers. This, in turn, prevents you from wasting time and effort with a traditional KYC onboarding process that is typically tedious. SelfKey additional minimizes data because of its blockchain-based verifiable claims protocol. This protocol lets you as an identity owner prove you meet the ID attributes required for a specific service or product without any need to actually share your identity document. In other words, you can provide proof of your ID without sharing the ID, keeping the data you send to a minimum. Of course, SelfKey also provides the full functionality you want from a cryptocurrency wallet, including the ability to securely manage cryptocurrency assets like ETH, KEY, and the other ERC-20 tokens.Edmund Lowell is the founder of SelfKey. \r\n\r\nOn his LinkedIn page, Edmund describes himself as an entrepreneur whose \u201Cskill sets lie at the crossroads of finance, technology, and law/regulations.\u201D Additionally, he has been involved with other projects related to personal data protection, self-sovereign digital identity systems, blockchains, and distributed ledgers. Terry Lin is the product manager for this venture. In the past, Terry has been associated with many established projects including, AMZ Tracker, UBS and Build My Online Store.

Steem aims to provide various services to its members such as a source of curated news, Q\u0026A, job boards etc. The founders of Steem came from \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitshares\u0022\u003EBitShares\u003C/a\u003E with Dan Larimer involved as well.\r\n\r\nSteem\u2019s main platform, called Steemit, is a social media network built on top of the Steem blockchain. Steemit is similar to popular content-driven social networks like Reddit and Medium, but it rewards users with cryptocurrency for their participation. Fundamentally, the more value a particular piece of content provides to a greater number of people, the more the individuals responsible for creating and curating that content can earn.\r\n\r\nUsers cast votes, creating a hierarchy of content. The more upvotes a post gets, the more it will earn. The platform also allows for downvotes, giving participants more flexibility when it comes to rating content. Steemit is meritocratic, meaning users that hold more currency can cast votes with greater influence.\r\n\r\nThe Steemit community even has another service to offer to its customers. D.tube, which is considered to be very similar to YouTube, is Blockchain based and the users can realize the difference between the traditional video publishing websites and D.tube, as the amount of money earned is also displayed beside the post apart from likes shares and comments. The Steemit community is accused of posting plagiarize contents on their publishing website. The irony seems to be reaching highest levels when the original content doesn\u2019t receive much appreciation and income than the copied versions of it.\u0022",

However, users of the Axelar network do not need to hold the token. Conversions into AXL tokens and destination-chain tokens are handled on the back end, so that users need only pay gas once, in the source-chain token.\r\n\r\nAxelar network rewards are \u201Cinflationary\u201D \u2014 they increase the total supply of AXL \u2014 but there is potential for supply to become deflationary based on the transaction fee mechanic described above.

Maker offers a transparent stablecoin system that is fully inspectable on the Ethereum blockchain. Founded almost three years ago, MakerDao is lead by Rune Christensen, its CEO and founder. Maker\u2019s MKR coin is a recent entrant to the market and is not a well known project. However, after today it will be known by many more people after blowing up 40% and it is one of the coins to rise to prominence during the recent peaks and troughs.\r\n\r\nAfter being developed by the MakerDAO team, Maker Dai officially went live on December 18th, 2017. Dai is a price stable coin that is suitable for payments, savings, or collateral and provides cryptocurrency traders with increased options concerning opening and closing positions. Dai lives completely on the blockchain chain with its stability unmediated by the legal system or trusted counterparties and helps facilitate trading while staying entirely in the world of cryptocurrencies. The concept of a stablecoin is fairly straight forward \u2013 it\u2019s a token that has its price or value pegged to a particular fiat currency. A stablecoin is a token (like \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\u0022\u003EBitcoin\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\u0022\u003EEthereum\u003C/a\u003E) that exists on a blockchain, but unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum, Dai has no volatility.\r\n\r\nMKR is an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain and can not be mined. It\u2019s instead created/destroyed in response to DAI price fluctuations in order to keep it hovering around $1 USD. MKR is used to pay transaction fees on the Maker system, and it collateralizes the system. Holding MKR comes with voting rights within Maker\u2019s continuous approval voting system. Bad governance devalues MKR tokens, so MKR holders are incentivized to vote for the good of the entire system. It\u2019s a fully decentralized and democratic structure, then, which is an underutilized USP of blockchain tech.\r\n\r\nValue volatility is a relative concept among both cryptos and fiat currencies. The US dollar, for example, was worth 110.748 yen on July 9, 2018. On July 4, 2011, $1 was worth 80.64 yen, and on March 18, 1985, $1 was worth 255.65 yen. These are major differences in exchange rates, and inflation within each country makes each currency worth different values even when compared to themselves. One USD in 1913 is worth the equivalent of $25.41 today, and even $1 in 1993 is worth the equivalent of $1.74 today. Stablecoins don\u2019t negate these basic economic principles of value. Instead, both Tether and Dai have values pegged to the U.S. dollar. This is done to stabilize the price.",

    "Description": "What is Radiant Capital?\r\n\r\nProject Overview\r\n\r\nCapital in DeFi is extremely fragmented across chains, evidenced by the dozens of different money markets, all with their own liquidity.\r\n\r\nRadiant aims to be an omnichain money market where users can deposit any major asset on any major chain and borrow various supported assets across multiple chains, eliminating the need for silos of liquidity.\r\n\r\nRadiant\u2019s cross-chain interoperability functions using LayerZero messaging and Stargate\u0027s stable router interface. For example, lenders may reclaim their collateral and can direct which chain to withdraw funds from and what percentage they\u2019d like sent to each chain.\r\n\r\nRadiant aims to solve DeFi 1.0 issues of unpredictable and transient liquidity through its innovative Dynamic Liquidity Providers (dLP) and gated emissions.\r\n\r\nValue Proposition\r\n\r\nConsolidation of Fragmented Liquidity: The primary goal of the Radiant DAO is to consolidate billions in fragmented liquidity across multiple lending protocols and chains under one safe, user-friendly, and capital-efficient cross-chain protocol. This consolidation of fragmented liquidity is intended to enhance the overall DeFi ecosystem and create a more seamless experience for users.\r\n\r\nGated Emissions: Sustainability is an important Key Performance Indicator to the Radiant DAO and thus the protocol implemented a Dynamic Liquidity (dLP) mechanism which only enables incentivized RDNT emissions to dLP providers. Dynamic Liquidity Provisioners also share in the utility of platform fees captured in blue-chip assets such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, BNB, and stablecoins through borrowing interest, flash loans, and liquidations.\r\n\r\nProject Key Highlights\r\n\r\nOmnichain Money Market: Users can deposit and borrow assets across chains seamlessly within minutes via Radiant\u2019s integrations with LayerZero and the Stargate stable router interface, which solves many DeFi pain points related to requiring multiple transactions to lend, borrow, bridge, and swap.\r\n\r\nDeFi 3.0: Early iterations of DeFi featured many copycat protocols with zero utility and high-emission governance tokens. In the Radiant DAO\u2019s V2 launch, Radiant will continue to allow all users to borrow and lend cross-chain, seamlessly. However, emissions are gated to only users which provide utility to the protocol in the form of Dynamic Liquidity Provisioning\r\n\r\nSupport for 20\u002B Collateral Options: As the Radiant DAO expands its cross-chain functionality to additional chains, new collateral options will emerge with DAO-voted Loan-To-Value parameters and oracle usage.",

    "Description": "Wanchain seeks to link the present to the future, through the exploration and implementation of blockchain technology. Wanchain aims to build a distributed \u201Cbank\u201D. Just as traditional banks are the infrastructure of the current financial framework, Wanchain seeks to build a new, distributed infrastructure of digital assets to form an improved, modern framework - an ambitious goal indeed.\r\n\r\nWanchain connects and exchanges value between different blockchain ledgers in a distributed manner. It uses the latest cryptographic theories to build a non-proprietary cross-chain protocol and a distributed ledger that records both cross-chain and intra-chain transactions. Any blockchain network, whether a public, private or consortium chain, can integrate with Wanchain to establish connections between different ledgers and perform low cost inter-ledger asset transfers. The Wanchain ledger supports not only smart contracts, but also token exchange privacy protection.\r\n\r\nWith Wanchain, any institution or individual can set up their own virtual teller window in the \u201Cbank\u201D and provide services such as loan origination, asset exchanges, credit payments and transaction settlements based on digital assets. Under the guarantee of \u201Cbanks\u201D based on the blockchain infrastructure, more people can participate in financial services based on digital assets. To describe it more accurately, Wanchain is a distributed super-financial market based on blockchain.\r\n\r\nWanchain uses the Locked Account Generation Scheme to secure funds and keys when there are multiple parties involved. Based on Shamir\u2019s Secret Sharing Scheme, it effectively breaks up a key into shares and distributes it to all included participants. The Storemen are responsible for maintaining and managing the appropriate key shares of the locked accounts for transactions. This method of key share distribution has a few benefits. Because Wanchain generates locked accounts through multi-party computations, there\u2019s increased decentralization. And there\u2019s more stability because you don\u2019t need every key share to produce a signature for a locked account. If some of the Validators are offline, transactions can still be executed with a minimum number of shares. Finally, any transaction with a locked account is done via the original chain. This means that any chain can easily integrate and interact with Wanchain without the need for new transaction types or validators.\r\n\r\nThe Wanchain Foundation is a non-profit organization primarily operating out of Singapore but also has a significant presence in Austin, TX. Wanchain was founded by Jack Lu, a respected player in the blockchain space. Before his current role, Lu co-founded \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/factom\u0022\u003EFactom\u003C/a\u003E and started Wanglu Tech, a blockchain application development company. Wanglu Tech has been a primary contributor to the open-source Wanchain project. Dustin Byington serves as the Wanchain President. Byington is a blockchain veteran having founded Bitcoin College in 2014 as well as co-founding Tendermint, a software mechanism to securely and consistently replicate applications across machines. Byington also co-founded Satoshi Talent, a platform to connect blockchain entrepreneurs with developers. WAN tokens were initially distributed as ERC-20 tokens to ICO participants, but it\u2019s now possible to exchange these for tokens on the Wanchain mainnet or buy them directly. It\u2019s a common misconception that WAN is an ERC-20 coin.\r\n\r\nWanchain is a pioneering and potentially disruptive project with its sights set on becoming a super financial market of the world. Although achieving its lofty goal(s) is going to require a lot more work, Wanchain is further along its roadmap than some projects. But there\u2019s still a good bit of \u201Cin theory\u201D going on here. As Wanchain is addressing the whole financial market, it has a number of competitors. Most notably \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/fusion\u0022\u003EFusion\u003C/a\u003E, Pantos, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ark\u0022\u003EArk\u003C/a\u003E, and \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/qash\u0022\u003EQash\u003C/a\u003E; some may even consider big players the likes of \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ripple\u0022\u003ERipple\u003C/a\u003E, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/stellar\u0022\u003EStellar\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\u0022\u003EEthereum\u003C/a\u003E competitors. On the positive side, Wanchain has strong fundamentals, they\u2019ve got a functional mainnet, the vitality of their use case is indisputable, the huge interest in their ICO showed a powerful vein of investor confidence, and the team has a track record of success.",

    "Description": "What is Hydranet (HDN)?\r\nHydranet is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization building the Hydranet DEX, a Layer 3 trading platform that brings together the worlds of Bitcoin and Ethereum using Layer 2 off-chain protocols such as the Lightning Network and the Connext Vector Network. Hydranet\u2019s novel exchange technology allows users to trade seamlessly between Bitcoin and EVM-based blockchains without relinquishing custody of their funds, with near instant settlement times, and for low costs.\u00A0\r\n\r\nThe Hydranet DEX includes a limit order book, which is hosted by the Hydranet Network, and a built-in multi-currency light wallet that allows users to store both BTC and EVM-based assets. Trades on the Hydranet DEX are executed off-chain, fully peer-to-peer, and are secured using hashed timelock contracts meaning either both peers or no peer receives the agreed upon funds. Since Layer 2 off-chain protocols are scaling solutions for Layer 1 blockchains, users will always remain in full custody of their private keys.\u00A0\r\n\r\nHydranet released the first version of the Hydranet DEX on the 23rd of September 2023. This version is delivered as a downloadable desktop client and offers a user-friendly interface, seamless trading experience, and robust security features. Hydranet is actively working on an upgraded version of their DEX, a platform agnostic web version which will be readily available from the browser. The web version will inherit all the commendable components of its desktop counterpart as well as Hydranet\u2019s in-house EVM off-chain protocol, Lithium.\u00A0\r\n\r\nWhat powers the Hydranet DEX?\u00A0\r\nThe Hydranet DEX is powered by the Hydranet Network, an infrastructure overseen by two distinct actors: TItans and Guardians. Titans take on the responsibility of ensuring the network\u2019s continuous operation. They achieve this by hosting the exchange\u2019s limit order book, offering rental liquidity, and acting as a matchmaking engine between trading peers. Guardians, on the other hand, take on the responsibility of upholding the network\u2019s integrity. They actively monitor the behavior of both traders and Titans to ensure that they comply with the network\u2019s rules, and take appropriate measures to penalize those who violate these rules.\u00A0\r\n\r\nBoth Titans and Guardians require a collateral in the form of HDN to participate in their respective roles. In return for their services, they become eligible to receive a share of the trading fees generated by the Hydranet DEX.\r\n\r\nWhat makes Hydranet Unique?\r\nHydranet effectively addresses the critical challenges associated with self-custody, transaction times, transaction costs, and scalability. When it comes to decentralized trading directly on the blockchain, using Automated Market Makers (AMMs) is a popular choice for trustless trading. However, it often comes with the drawback of high blockchain fees and prolonged transaction times due to the scalability limitations of many blockchain networks. As an alternative, traders can opt for centralized exchanges, which often offer user-friendly interfaces, fast transaction times and low trading fees. The convenience they provide, unfortunately, comes at the cost of relinquishing custody of user funds and leaving them entirely in the hands of the centralized exchanges to do whatever they want with. This issue has been exemplified by the FTX incident, which is reported to have negatively impacted over 1 million crypto users.\u00A0\r\n\r\nUnlike today\u2019s centralized and decentralized exchanges, the Hydranet DEX offers a unique solution to the challenges previously presented. First and foremost, the Hydranet DEX operates on a trustless basis, meaning users always retain control of their funds, eliminating the risks associated with third-parties. Moreover, the Hydranet DEX leverages off-chain technologies to enhance transaction times and reduce costs significantly. By keeping the transaction process off the main blockchains, trades are executed near-instantly and for minimal fees, even cross-chain, in contrast to the high fees and slow transaction times experienced using many decentralized exchanges operating directly on the blockchain. Lastly, when it comes to scalability, the Hydranet DEX is designed to scale indefinitely. A key element for this is Hydranet\u2019s decentralized execution of trades. Unlike conventional solutions, where a centralized entity typically executes the trade, in the Hydranet DEX, the trade execution is distributed among the trading peers themselves. The Hydranet Network assists in matching trading peers but leaves the rest in the hands of the peers to automatically execute the trade without user intervention.\u00A0",

    "Description": "Ardor is the latest in the growing field of contenders for blockchain as a service (BaaS) providers. Ardor provides the blockchain infrastructure for businesses and institutions to leverage the strengths of blockchain technology without having to invest in developing custom blockchain solutions. Instead, Ardor offers a main chain that handles blockchain security and decentralization plus customizable child chains that come ready to use, right out of the box, for various business applications. Ardor goes beyond Nxt to solve critical issues of blockchain bloat, scalability, and customization.\r\n\r\nNxt is a well respected, verified, and established blockchain technology with a comparatively long history and an experienced development team. However, as blockchain usage increases over the coming years Nxt, and other blockchain technologies, will face some fundamental problems with payments, scalability, and customization. The first and most straightforward problem is the use of native tokens for transaction fees. Nxt uses a forging proof of stake system, meaning that the total token supply has already been created and new tokens aren\u2019t created with each block. Instead, the forgers that verify the blocks receive a portion of the transaction fees paid on the network. As such, the transaction fees need to be paid in NXT, even if you\u2019ve created a new currency that\u2019s independent of Nxt, you\u2019ll still need to own NXT in order to pay miners, diluting the value of your own currency. \r\n\r\nTo test Ardor\u2019s capabilities and serve as an example of an operating child chain, the Ardor developers have created Ignis. Ignis will implement all of the customizable features that come from the Nxt code base. Essentially, Ignis will be a proof of concept and could be the first of many more child chains on the Ardor platform. The \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ignis\u0022\u003EIgnis\u003C/a\u003E ICO recently raised $15 million in funding for development. In the future, Ardor child chains could be used to create equity trading platforms, digital file transfer services, private enterprise blockchain applications, and many more use cases. Ardor\u2019s strengths are quick time to setup and wide customizability, making it a great option for companies looking to leverage blockchain without the resources to dedicate to custom development.\r\n\r\nArdor has many architectural advantages. One of them and perhaps the most influential one is that it has been created using Java; one of the most widespread programming languages in the world today. This is definitely a step in the right direction seeing as it becomes ten times easier for a commercial application to succeed if the development language is one which most programmers can relate to.",

Nano by design is a simple protocol with the sole purpose of being a high-performance cryptocurrency. The Nano protocol can run on low-power hardware, allowing it to be a practical, decentralized cryptocurrency for everyday use.\r\n\r\nThe original Nano (RailBlocks) paper and first beta implementation were published in December, 2014, making it one of the first \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.coingecko.com/en?hashing_algorithm=Directed\u002BAcyclic\u002BGraph\u002B%28DAG%29\u0022\u003EDirected Acyclic Graph (DAG)\u003C/a\u003E based cryptocurrencies [6].

Nano achieves consensus via a balance-weighted vote on conflicting transactions. This consensus system provides quicker, more deterministic transactions while still maintaining a strong, decentralized system. Nano continues this development and has positioned itself as one of the highest performing cryptocurrencies.\r\n\r\nNano is a trustless, feeless, low-latency cryptocurrency that utilizes a novel blocklattice structure and \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.coingecko.com/en?hashing_algorithm=Delegated\u002BProof-of-Stake\u0022\u003Edelegated Proof of Stake\u003C/a\u003E voting. The network requires minimal resources, no high-power mining hardware, and can process high transaction throughput. All of this is achieved by having individual blockchains for each account, eliminating access issues and inefficiencies of a global data-structure. We identified possible attack vectors on the system and presented arguments on how Nano is resistant to these forms of attacks.\r\n\r\nCheck out \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.coinbureau.com/review/nano/\u0022\u003ECoinBureau\u003C/a\u003E for the complete review of Nano.",

    "Description": "Zilliqa (ZIL) is a token developed in the year 2017. Zilliqa is mainly based on the concept of Sharding and primarily aims at improving the scalability of the cryptocurrency networks as in case of Bitcoin or Ethereum. The white paper mentions that the transactions speed would be approximately a thousand times more than that of Ethereum network. Ziliqa is fast, secured and decentralized. Zilliqa\u2019s high throughput means that you can focus on developing your ideas without worrying about network congestion, high transaction fees or security which are the key issues with legacy blockchain platforms. Zilliqa network uses a concept called Sharding where the transactions are grouped into smaller groups and divided among the miners for the parallel transactional verification. Developing smaller groups for transactional verification means the Consensus can be reached faster and hence a higher number of transactions can be processed in a given time frame. The capacity of the network linearly increases in other cryptocurrencies as the number of people joins the network, but in this case, the capacity is increased at a higher variable rate than the number of members joining the network. By incorporating the Sharding Technology, it can completely revolutionize the smart contract functionality too. Ziliqa has few pros as it has a great new technology. Zilliqa is the first platform to use sharding technology. This puts it ahead of the rest of the market. It\u2019s a completely new kind of blockchain designed to solve the problem of scalability. Third-generation platforms like Zilliqa could be the big winners in the future of cryptocurrency. Ziliqa has a strong community. The platform has a lot of fans. The Zilliqa ICO only happened because there was so much demand for it. The Zilliqa ICO also shows that the crypto community is ready to see blockchain technology move to the next phase of its development.",

By leveraging zkEVM, developers can reduce gas costs, optimize contract execution speed, and enable confidential computation.\r\n\r\nWhat makes your project unique?\r\nGameSwift not only provides an optimized SDK-based infrastructure for game developers to deploy their dApps efficiently and securely on zkEVM, but also introduces the multichain GameSwift Platform, which ensures that the games built within the modular ecosystem are not isolated from other networks. The Platform provides solutions that respond to the needs of non-crypto gamers, who may not be familiar with interacting with blockchain technology.\r\n\r\nHistory of your project.\r\nFounded in 2022 by a group of blockchain and gaming passionates, GameSwift quickly became one of the fastest-growing gaming ecosystems in the entire Web3 space, which now makes a true home for numerous gaming projects and gamers.\r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s next for your project?\r\nGameSwift\u0027s long-term goal is to become the go-to blockchain network for development studios to build and launch their dedicated gaming roll-ups, easily accessible to both web3 and web2 gamers through the one-stop multichain platform. By unifying games and players in one place, GameSwift aims to create the World\u2019s largest web3 gaming community.\r\n\r\nWhat can your token be used for?\r\n$GSWIFT is the driving force behind the entire GameSwift ecosystem, serving as a native currency, utility, and governance token, capturing value from all GameSwift products and services. Being an essential component for key functionalities, such as transaction fees, validation, and payments on GameSwift layer 1 blockchain or validating transactions on zkEVM roll-ups, makes $GSWIFT a crucial asset in the entire GameSwift Ecosystem, which additionally accrues real yield generated by the GameSwift Platform from multiple revenues streams.\r\n\r\n",

A fully decentralized protocol, Illuvium represents a new age in gaming. It has been engineered from the ground-up to increase the value of the underlying $ILV token while providing players with a AAA experience. What makes Illuvium unique is that stakers receive regular distributions and can vote on everything from tokenomics related issues to the features in the game itself. With Illuvium, the power to define the project into the future is purposefully left to those who stake in the protocol.",

This generalization of Nakamoto consensus allows for secure operation while maintaining very high block rates (currently one block per second, aiming for 10/sec, dreaming of 100/sec) and minuscule confirmation times dominated by internet latency (cf. chapter 6 of the the paper for some initial benchmarks).

Bitcoin Cash intends to be a Bitcoin without Segregated Witness (SegWit) as soft fork, where upgrades of the protocol are done mainly through hard forks and without changing the original economic rules of the Bitcoin.\r\n\r\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) is released on 1st August 2017 as an upgraded version of the original \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin/developer#panel\u0022\u003EBitcoin Core software\u003C/a\u003E. The main upgrade is the increase in the block size limit from 1MB to 8MB. This effectively allows miners on the BCH chain to process up to 8 times more payments per second in comparison to Bitcoin. This makes for faster, cheaper transactions and a much smoother user experience.\r\n\r\nWhy was Bitcoin Cash Created?\r\n\r\nThe main objective of Bitcoin Cash is to to bring back the essential qualities of money inherent in the original Bitcoin software. Over the years, these qualities were filtered out of Bitcoin Core and progress was stifled by various people, organizations, and companies involved in Bitcoin protocol development. The result is that Bitcoin Core is currently unusable as money due to increasingly high fees per transactions and transfer times taking hours to complete. This is all because of the 1MB limitation of Bitcoin Core\u2019s block size, causing it unable to accommodate to large number of transactions.\r\n\r\nEssentially Bitcoin Cash is a community-activated upgrade (otherwise known as a hard fork) of Bitcoin that increased the block size to 8MB, solving the scaling issues that plague Bitcoin Core today.\r\n\r\nNov 16th 2018: A hashwar resulted in a split between \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin-cash-sv\u0022\u003EBitcoin SV\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin-cash-abc\u0022\u003EBitcoin ABC\u003C/a\u003E",

    "Description": "Litecoin is a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency created by Charlie Lee. It was created based on the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\u0022\u003EBitcoin\u003C/a\u003E protocol but differs in terms of the hashing algorithm used. Litecoin uses the memory intensive \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.coingecko.com/en?hashing_algorithm=Scrypt\u0022\u003EScrypt proof of work\u003C/a\u003E mining algorithm. Scrypt allows consumer-grade hardware such as GPU to mine those coins.\r\n\r\nWhy Litecoin?\r\nLitecoin is a cryptocurrency that has evolved from Bitcoin after its own popularity in the industry, this alternative, or \u2018altcoin\u2019 has emerged to allow investors to diversify their digital currency package, according to Investopedia. Litecoin is one of the most prominent altcoins and was created by former Google employee and Director of Engineering at \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/coinbase_pro\u0022\u003ECoinbase\u003C/a\u003E, Charlie Lee. Litecoin was the first to alter Bitcoin and the most significant difference is that it takes 2.5 minutes for Litecoin to generate a block, or transaction, in comparison to Bitcoin\u0027s 10 minutes.\r\n\r\n\u2018While this matters little to traders, miners who use hardware to run Bitcoin\u0027s network cannot switch over to Litecoin. This keeps bigger mining conglomerates away from Litecoin because they cannot easily optimize their profits by swapping to another coin, contributing to a more decentralized experience. Litecoin also has bigger blocks, and more coins in circulation, making it more affordable and swift when transacting,\u2019 Investopedia explained.\r\n\r\nAs explained above, Litecoin can transact a lot faster than Bitcoin, but there are also a number of other characteristics that investors need to know before trading. Litecoin can handle higher volumes of transactions because of the capability of transacting faster and if Bitcoin attempted to transact on the scale of its altcoin, a code update would be needed. However, Litecoin\u2019s blocks would be larger, but with more \u2018orphaned blocks\u0027. The faster block time of litecoin reduces the risk of double spending attacks - this is theoretical in the case of both networks having the same hashing power.\r\n\r\nLitecoin Technical Details:\r\nThe transaction confirmation time taken for Litecoin is about 2.5 minutes on average (as compared to Bitcoin\u0027s 10 minutes). The Litecoin network is scheduled to cap at 84 million currency units. \r\n\r\nLitecoin has inspired many other popular alternative currencies (eg. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dogecoin\u0022\u003EDogecoin\u003C/a\u003E) because of its Scrypt hashing algorithm in order to prevent ASIC miners from mining those coins. However it is said that by the end of this year, Scrypt ASIC will enter the mass market.",

    "Description": "What is DigiByte?\r\nDigiByte is more than a faster digital currency. It is an innovative blockchain that can be used for digital assets, smart contracts, decentralized applications and secure authentication.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat makes DigiByte stronger than others?\r\nDigiByte is a rapidly growing open-source blockchain created in late 2013 and released in early 2014. After 6 years of forward thinking development, DigiByte has become one of the safest, fastest, longest and most decentralized UTXO blockchain in existence.\r\n\r\n\r\nTruly Decentralized.\r\nDigiByte has never been funded through an ICO or significant amount of premined coins. There is no CEO or a company controlling the DigiByte blockchain. It is a volunteer based and global community driven project.\r\n\r\n\r\nMore secure.\r\nDigiByte uses 5 cryptographic algorithms and real time difficulty adjustment to prevent malicious mining centralization and hash power fluctuation. One of which is Odocrypt that changes itself every 10 days for ASIC resistance.\r\n\r\n\r\nMuch faster.\r\nDigiByte blocks occur every 15 seconds which is 40x faster than Bitcoin and 10x faster than Litecoin. Early SegWit implementation and blockchain rigidity enable up to 1066 on-chain transactions per second with negligible fees.\r\n\r\n\r\nForward thinking.\r\nOver the past 6 years, DigiByte has repeatedly set itself apart with multiple blockchain firsts, such asDigiShield guard, MultiAlgo mining, SegWit implementation, Odocrypt algorithm, Dandelion\u002B\u002B privacy protocol, DigiAssets and Digi-ID.\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\nThis is how the DigiByte blockchain works.\r\nThe three layers are the most innovative parts of the DigiByte blockchain providing the network infrastructure, security and communications to function with cutting edge speed.\r\n \r\n\r\nApplications / DigiAssets.\r\nThe top layer is like an app store with clear real-world uses. All types of digital assets can be created with the DigiAssets protocol on top of the DigiByte blockchain. Decentralized applications (dApps) can be built on top of the DigiByte blockchain. Also smart contracts that leverage the rigidity and security of the DigiByte blockchain can be encoded easily.\r\n\r\n\r\nDigital asset / Public ledger.\r\nThe middle layer provides security and administration. A Digital Byte of data, a representation of larger data or a unit that holds value, and cannot be counterfeited, duplicated or hacked. An immutable public ledger where all transactions of DigiBytes are recorded. DigiByte uses five proof of work algorithms for security. New DigiBytes come from mining only.\r\n\r\n\r\nCore protocol / Global network.\r\nThe bottom layer provides communication and operating procedures. A very low-level way nodes on the DigiByte global network communicate. Thousands of people are running DigiByte software all across the planet. Any server, computer, tablet or mobile phone connected to the DigiByte network becomes a node that helps relay transactions.\r\n\r\n \r\nOpen source / Permissionless.\r\nJust like the DigiByte.io website, the DigiByte blockchain is completely open source and free to use released under the MIT license, which gives you the power to run and modify the software. Transparency allows for independent verification of binaries and their corresponding source code.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nA digital currency you would absolutely love.\r\nDigiByte (DGB) is a highly scalable peer-to-peer digital currency that enables industry-leading transaction speeds with negligible fees. DigiByte is the best way for payments.\r\n\r\n\r\nEasy to use.\r\nGetting started to use DigiByte is even easier than sending an SMS. You can send and receive DigiBytes using the devices you already know and love. All you need is installing a DigiByte supported wallet then click scan, scan the QR code and send DigiByte. As easy as 1..2..3.\r\n\r\n\r\nNot an ICO.\r\nDigiByte has never been funded through an ICO or significant amount of premined coins (0% remaining). There is no CEO or a company controlling the DigiByte blockchain. The founder, developers and the community are unpaid volunteers that eliminate the bankrupt risk.\r\n\r\n\r\nMuch faster.\r\nDigiByte transactions are confirmed in approx. 15 seconds, which is 40 times faster than Bitcoin and 10 times faster than Litecoin. SegWit enables up to 1066 on-chain transactions per second and negligible fees make DigiByte the ideal currency for daily payments.\r\n\r\n \r\nAlways secure.\r\nDigiByte has been built on the uncrackable technology of the Bitcoin blockchain and implemented various advanced enhancements over it such as DigiShield guard, MultiAlgo mining and the Odocrypt algorithm. Also Dandelion\u002B\u002B privacy protocol helps keep you safe by hiding your IP and physical location. Learn more.\r\n\r\n\r\nMineable.\r\nDigiByte is a 100% Proof of Work (PoW) blockchain that can be mined with five algorithms called Sha256, Scrypt, Skein, Qubit and Odocrypt. MultiAlgo mining contributes to decentralization, security of the network and gives you the freedom to use different kind of hardware\u0027s such as an ASIC a FPGA or a GPU. Learn more.\r\n\r\n\r\nManageable units\r\nCompared to 21 million Bitcoin, 21 billion DigiByte (1000:1 ratio to BTC) have been designed to be ready for mass adoption. DigiByte block rewards reduces by 1% every month instead of halving every 4 years. All 21 billion DigiByte will be mined by the year 2035. After 2035 the miners will then rely on transaction fees alone. Learn more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA simplified way to create digital assets.\r\nDigiAssets is a secure, scalable layer on top of the DigiByte blockchain that allows for the decentralized issuance of assets, tokens, smart contracts, digital identity and more.\r\n\r\n\r\nLimitless possibilities.\r\nDigiAssets can be used to securely represent anything we find in the physical world. From tangible assets such as real estate or cars, through to scarce digital pieces of art. Signed documents such as deeds and medical bills can be protected.\r\n\r\n\r\nGrowing confidently.\r\nDigiAssets as an ecosystem and platform already has interested parties either planning on or currently building platforms in real estate, finance, remittance, identity, point of sale, racing, trade, healthcare, supply chain, government and more.\r\n\r\n\r\nSolid technology.\r\nDigiAssets leverages unique aspects of a truly decentralized blockchain only found within a permissionless blockchain like DigiByte. This allows DigiAssets to be more secure, scalable and decentralized than any other platform in the market.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nAuthentication at its best.\r\nDigi-ID is a security protocol built on DigiByte blockchain technology that empowers users to effortlessly sign-in to websites, applications, and even into the internet of things.\r\n \r\n\r\nEasy authentication.\r\nDigi-ID eliminates the username, password and 2fa requirements for authentication. Because Digi-ID uses public / private key cryptography, there are no passwords or usernames at risk. This method not only protects the consumer, it also protects the services that the consumer uses.\r\n \r\n\r\nFlawless security.\r\nDigi-ID does not store any data about its users on the DigiByte blockchain. This further strengthens the security while also bolstering end-user\u2019s confidence that their data is neither tracked nor at risk by others negligence. There is no external point of failure for an hacker to exploit your platform.\r\n\r\n\r\nSimple and free.\r\nDigi-ID is completely free! There are no fees, subscription services, or maintenance costs. But the cost is its second best feature. Its primary feature is that, in accordance with DigiBytes security prioritization, Digi-ID is a more secure, yet simple method available to log in to websites, apps and more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most passionate community ever!\r\nTens of thousands of volunteers from all over the world have contributed to DigiByte in countless ways for years to make it what it is today. It is a truly grassroots movement. We warmly welcome you to join us!\r\n\r\n\r\nDigiByte Foundation.\r\nThe DigiByte Foundation is a volunteer managed organization that operates in a non-profit way. They protect and promote the true principles of decentralization and empower DigiByte and its community to establish and maintain a sustainable decentralized world.\r\nLearn more.\r\n \r\n\r\nDigiByte Awareness Team.\r\n\r\nDGBAT is a community-driven outreach initiative.

    "Description": "Ripple is the catchall name for the cryptocurrency platform, the transactional protocol for which is actually XRP, in the same fashion as \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\u0022\u003EEthereum\u003C/a\u003E is the name for the platform that facilitates trades in Ether. Like other cryptocurrencies, Ripple is built atop the idea of a distributed ledger network which requires various parties to participate in validating transactions, rather than any singular centralized authority. That facilitates transactions all over the world, and transfer fees are far cheaper than the likes of bitcoin. Unlike other cryptocurrencies, XRP transfers are effectively immediate, requiring no typical confirmation time.\r\n\r\nRipple was originally founded by a single company, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/ripple-labs\u0022\u003ERipple Labs\u003C/a\u003E, and continues to be backed by it, rather than the larger network of developers that continue \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\u0022\u003Ebitcoin\u2019s\u003C/a\u003E development. It also doesn\u2019t have a fluctuating amount of its currency in existence. Where bitcoin has a continually growing pool with an eventual maximum, and Ethereum theoretically has no limit, Ripple was created with all of its 100 billion XRP tokens right out of the gate. That number is maintained with no mining and most of the tokens are owned and held by Ripple Labs itself \u2014 around 60 billion at the latest count.\r\n\r\nEven at the recently reduced value of around half a dollar per XRP, that means Ripple Labs is currently sitting on around $20 billion worth of the cryptocurrency (note: Ripple\u2019s price crashed hard recently, and may be worth far less than $60 billion by time you read this). It holds 55 billion XRP in an escrow account, which allows it to sell up to a billion per month if it so chooses in order to fund new projects and acquisitions. Selling such an amount would likely have a drastic effect on the cryptocurrency\u2019s value, and isn\u2019t something Ripple Labs plans to do anytime soon.\r\n\r\nIn actuality, Ripple Labs is looking to leverage the technology behind XRP to allow for faster banking transactions around the world. While Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are built on the idea of separating financial transactions from the financial organizations of traditional currencies, Ripple is almost the opposite in every sense.\r\n\r\nXRP by Ripple price can be found on this page alongside the market capitalization and additional stats.\r\n\r\n",

    "Description": "The Stellar network is an open source, distributed, and community owned network used to facilitate cross-asset transfers of value. Stellar aims to help facilitate cross-asset transfer of value at a fraction of a penny while aiming to be an open financial system that gives people of all income levels access to low-cost financial services. Stellar can handle exchanges between fiat-based currencies and between cryptocurrencies. Stellar.org, the organization that supports Stellar, is centralized like \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ripple\u0022\u003EXRP\u003C/a\u003E and meant to handle cross platform transactions and micro transactions like XRP. However, unlike Ripple, Stellar.org is non-profit and their platform itself is open source and decentralized. \r\n\r\nStellar was founded by Jed McCaleb in 2014. Jed McCaleb is also the founder of Mt. Gox and co-founder of Ripple, launched the network system Stellar with former lawyer Joyce Kim. Stellar is also a payment technology that aims to connect financial institutions and drastically reduce the cost and time required for cross-border transfers. In fact, both payment networks used the same protocol initially.\r\n\r\nDistributed Exchange\r\nThrough the use of its intermediary currency Lumens (XLM), a user can send any currency that they own to anyone else in a different currency.\r\n\r\nFor instance, if Joe wanted to send USD to Mary using her EUR, an offer is submitted to the distributed exchange selling USD for EUR. This submitted offer forms is known as an order book. The network will use the order book to find the best exchange rate for the transaction in-order to minimize the fee paid by a user.\r\n\r\nThis multi-currency transaction is possible because of \u0022Anchors\u0022. Anchors are trusted entities that hold people\u2019s deposits and can issue credit. In essence, Anchors serves as the bridge between different currencies and the Stellar network.\r\n\r\nLumens (XLM)\r\nLumens are the native asset (digital currency) that exist on the Stellar network that helps to facilitate multi-currency transactions and prevent spams. For multi-currency transactions, XLM is the digital intermediary that allows for such a transaction to occur at a low cost.\r\n\r\nIn-order to prevent DoS attacks (aka spams) that would inevitably occur on the Stellar network, a small fee of 0.00001 XLM is associated with every transaction that occurs on the network. This fee is small enough so it does not significantly affect the cost of transaction, but large enough so it dissuades bad actors from spamming the network. \r\n\r\nPrior to Protocol 12, Stellar had a built-in inflation mechanism conceived to allow account holders to collectively direct inflation-generated lumens toward projects built on Stellar.\r\n\r\nAs the network evolved and grew, it became increasingly clear that inflation wasn\u2019t working as intended \u2014 account holders either didn\u2019t set their inflation destination or joined inflation pools to claim the inflation themselves, and the operational costs associated with inflation payments continued to rise \u2014 and so a protocol change to disable inflation was proposed, implemented, voted on by validators, and ultimately adopted as part of a network upgrade.\r\n\r\nThe inflation operation is now deprecated.\r\nhttps://developers.stellar.org/docs/glossary/inflation/\r\n",

In other words, the vision is to create a world computer that anyone can build applications in a decentralized manner; while all states and data are distributed and publicly accessible.

Examples of decentralized apps (dapps) that are built on Ethereum includes tokens, non-fungible tokens, decentralized finance apps, lending protocol, decentralized exchanges, and much more.\r\n\r\nOn Ethereum, all transactions and smart contract executions require a small fee to be paid. This fee is called Gas. In technical terms, Gas refers to the unit of measure on the amount of computational effort required to execute an operation or a smart contract. The more complex the execution operation is, the more gas is required to fulfill that operation. Gas fees are paid entirely in Ether (ETH), which is the native coin of the blockchain.

It was launched with the aim of becoming the \u2018official\u2019 cryptocurrency of Iceland. AUR was a pioneer in the area of country-specific cryptocurrencies. AUR was launched on the 25th of January, 2014, by an anonymous developer who went by the pseudonym of Baldur Friggjar \u00D3\u00F0insson. It was originally based on \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/litecoin\u0022\u003ELitecoin\u003C/a\u003E, using the Scrypt algorithm with a Proof of Work mechanism, but was later updated to use a multi-algorithm architecture in 2016, forked from \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/digibyte\u0022\u003EDigiByte\u003C/a\u003E.\r\n\r\nAuroracoin uses the PoW consensus mechanism, which utilises device hashing power to solve a complex mathematical problem in order to authenticate a transaction proposed to be stored in the blockchain. The difficulty of solving the problem ensures that authenticating forged transactions is very difficult unless the attacker owns an impractically large chunk of the network\u2019s total hashing power. AUR is one of the only cryptocurrencies to use a combination of five different hashing algorithms, namely Gr\u00F8stl, Qubit, scrypt, SHA-256, and Skein.\r\n\r\nWhile initially very popular, Auroracoin has seen little to no activity for a while, with poor marketing, and frequent dev team changes. Reasons for little growth have been various, from slow adoption in Iceland, to developers leaving and joining the project midway. However, it is expected to not go lower than the recent low, and might see a rise as AUR plans to launch a more aggressive marketing campaign in Iceland to promote the coin among the masses. Unlike most other altcoins, Auroracoin has made extensive changes to the original codebase. It has introduced security measures such as Automatic checkpointing, and protecting against known flaws present in the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\u0022\u003EBTC\u003C/a\u003E blockchain, such as 51% block replacement attacks.",

Loopring expects non-custodial exchanges can begin to outcompete and displace many centralized counterparts.",

It has custom digital identity standards that enable the creation of electronic identity data for individuals, organizations and even entities. These electronic systems use multi-layered authentication models that include facial and voice recognition as well as fingerprints.\r\n\r\nAll digital assets on the platform enjoy legal protection thanks to the use of digital certificates on its public blockchain. This, in turn, guarantees trust as the system offers an indelible and unalterable record of all entities\u2019 holdings.",

    "Description": "Tether (USDT) is a cryptocurrency with a value meant to mirror the value of the U.S. dollar. The idea was to create a stable cryptocurrency that can be used like digital dollars. Coins that serve this purpose of being a stable dollar substitute are called \u201Cstable coins.\u201D Tether is the most popular stable coin and even acts as a dollar replacement on many popular exchanges! According to their site, Tether converts cash into digital currency, to anchor or \u201Ctether\u201D the value of the coin to the price of national currencies like the US dollar, the Euro, and the Yen. Like other cryptos it uses blockchain. Unlike other cryptos, it is [according to the official Tether site] \u201C100% backed by USD\u201D (USD is held in reserve). The primary use of Tether is that it offers some stability to the otherwise volatile crypto space and offers liquidity to exchanges who can\u2019t deal in dollars and with banks (for example to the sometimes controversial but leading exchange \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/bitfinex\u0022\u003EBitfinex\u003C/a\u003E).\r\n\r\nThe digital coins are issued by a company called Tether Limited that is governed by the laws of the British Virgin Islands, according to the legal part of its website. It is incorporated in Hong Kong. It has emerged that Jan Ludovicus van der Velde is the CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex, which has been accused of being involved in the price manipulation of bitcoin, as well as tether. Many people trading on exchanges, including Bitfinex, will use tether to buy other cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. Tether Limited argues that using this method to buy virtual currencies allows users to move fiat in and out of an exchange more quickly and cheaply. Also, exchanges typically have rocky relationships with banks, and using Tether is a way to circumvent that.\r\n\r\nUSDT is fairly simple to use. Once on exchanges like \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/poloniex\u0022\u003EPoloniex\u003C/a\u003E or Bittrex, it can be used to purchase Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. It can be easily transferred from an exchange to any Omni Layer enabled wallet. Tether has no transaction fees, although external wallets and exchanges may charge one. In order to convert USDT to USD and vise versa through the Tether.to Platform, users must pay a small fee. Buying and selling Tether for Bitcoin can be done through a variety of exchanges like the ones mentioned previously or through the Tether.to platform, which also allows the conversion between USD to and from your bank account.",

    "Description": "The Cosmos network consists of many independent, parallel blockchains, called zones, each powered by classical Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) consensus protocols like Tendermint (already used by platforms like ErisDB). Some zones act as hubs with respect to other zones, allowing many zones to interoperate through a shared hub. The architecture is a more general application of the Bitcoin sidechains concept, using classic BFT and Proof-of-Stake algorithms, instead of Proof-of-Work.Cosmos can interoperate with multiple other applications and cryptocurrencies, something other blockchains can\u2019t do well. By creating a new zone, you can plug any blockchain system into the Cosmos hub and pass tokens back and forth between those zones, without the need for an intermediary.\r\n\r\nWhile the Cosmos Hub is a multi-asset distributed ledger, there is a special native token called the atom. Atoms have three use cases: as a spam-prevention mechanism, as staking tokens, and as a voting mechanism in governance.\r\n\r\nAs a spam prevention mechanism, Atoms are used to pay fees. The fee may be proportional to the amount of computation required by the transaction, similar to Ethereum\u2019s concept of \u201Cgas\u201D. Fee distribution is done in-protocol and a protocol specification is described here.\r\n\r\nAs staking tokens, Atoms can be \u201Cbonded\u201D in order to earn block rewards. The economic security of the Cosmos Hub is a function of the amount of Atoms staked. The more Atoms that are collateralized, the more \u201Cskin\u201D there is at stake and the higher the cost of attacking the network. Thus, the more Atoms there are bonded, the greater the economic security of the network.\r\n\r\nAtom holders may govern the Cosmos Hub by voting on proposals with their staked Atoms.",

Developers currently use ZetaChain\u2019s messaging capabilities to send data and native value (without wrapping assets) between any chains. ZetaChain will also support native smart contracts, which let developers build omnichain dApps that orchestrate funds across chains from a single contract.\r\n\r\nWho Are the Founders of ZetaChain?\r\n\r\nZetaChain\u2019s founder was an early Coinbase employee and one of the creators of Basic Attention Token (BAT). Investors include all major market makers, top exchanges, early Coinbase and Binance employees including Dan Romero, Sam Rosenblum, and John Yi, as well as major contributors to some of the industry\u2019s most widely adopted protocols and well known funds, including Polygon\u2019s JD Kanani. Advisors to the project include Coinbase\u2019s first Head of People Nathalie McGrath who scaled the industry leading exchange from 10 employees to over 800, and Juan Suarez, who served as in-house counsel at Coinbase from 2013 to 2022.\r\n\r\nWhat Makes ZetaChain Unique?\r\n\r\nZetaChain is a blockchain that connects everything. It enables interoperability between any blockchains or layers by providing cross-chain value transfer and message delivery, as well as native omnichain smart contract support. Applications built on ZetaChain \u2014 omnichain dApps (odApps) \u2014 can leverage liquidity and data on multiple networks and read and update state on all connected networks. ZetaChain\u2019s native omnichain smart contract platform lets developers deploy contracts with the same ease as developing dApps for a single network like Ethereum, that orchestrate data and value across many or all chains. ZetaChain\u2019s connectivity is chain-agnostic and can connect to and bring smart contract capabilities to even non-smart-contract chains like Bitcoin and Dogecoin. ",

As of 30 June 2015, the 100 billionth Dogecoin had been mined. \r\n\r\nDogecoin was created by Billy Markus from Portland, Oregon and  Jackson Palmer from Sydney, Australia.

The community is very active in organising fundraising activities for deserving causes.\r\n\r\nThe developers of Dogecoin haven\u2019t made any major changes to the coin since 2015.

However, this is also a weakness because other currencies are way more professional.\r\n\r\nTo purchase Dogecoin, it involves downloading a crypto wallet, setting up a crypto exchange account and then trading away for your desired crypto currency.

Due to its modularity, it is worth noting that Syscoin has three chains, its UTXO and [N]EVM chains comprise its Layer 1, and its Layer 2 currently consists of Rollux.\r\n\r\nRollux sets a new standard for Ethereum-compatible dApps by being the only EVM L2 secured by Bitcoin through merged mining. It\u0027s grounded in OP Stack and features PoDA (Proof-of-Data Availability), the most advanced data availability solution in the industry. This unique architecture makes Rollux the most secure, performant, affordable, and scalable rollup for Ethereum-compatible dApps.\r\n\r\nSyscoin aims to be at the forefront of smart contract applications, spanning Metaverse, IoT, Smart Cities, and even interplanetary economies. Looking forward, its roadmap is rich with cutting-edge technologies, including various ZK technologies like rollups, and DAOSYS\u2014a revolutionary DAO model designed for governance-free treasury management and self-sovereignty for all participants.\r\n\r\nEnvisioning a world with unprecedented financial inclusion, Syscoin seeks to empower every individual and business to benefit from Web3 and beyond. It brings together the capabilities of Ethereum and the original vision of Satoshi Nakamoto for Bitcoin, opening up unparalleled possibilities for a decentralized future.\r\n\r\nSyscoin offers its unique version of EVM, known as Network Enhanced Virtual Machine (NEVM), allowing it to host Ethereum-compatible smart contracts and rollups. In addition to Rollux, Syscoin features other Layer-2 solutions like Z-DAG and the Syscoin Bridge, further enhancing its scalability, interoperability, and performance.",

    "Description": "Tezos is a coin created by a former Morgan Stanley analyst, Arthur Breitman. It is a smart contract platform which is does not involve in mining Tezos coins. It is a coin that promotes themselves on major ideas of self-amendment and on-chain governance. It is an \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\u0022\u003EEthereum\u003C/a\u003E-like blockchain that hosts smart contracts. It allows the community to vote and improve its flaws. Any token holder may delegate their voting rights to others in the network. The coin uses a generic network shell which allow different transaction and consensus protocols that a blockchain needs to be compatible.\r\n\r\nThe source code is implemented on OCaml which is a fast, flexible and functional programming language which should suit an ambitious project and its technical requirements. Tezos\u2019 proof-of-stake consensus algorithm is different from the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.coingecko.com/en?hashing_algorithm=Delegated\u002BProof-of-Stake\u0026view=market\u0022\u003Edelegated proof-of-stake (dPOS)\u003C/a\u003E where they go by the name liquid proof-of-stake. This liquid proof-of-stake that Tezos uses focus in filling the gap between both security and decentralization but still being able to take advantage of the benefits that delegated proof-of-stake offers. The staking process in Tezos is called \u201Cbaking\u201D. In this blockchain, bakers who make deposits will be rewarded for signing up and publishing blocks. However, if a baker commits any bad behavior the deposits will be forfeited.\r\n\r\nBaking \u0026 Endorsing\r\nBaking is what Tezos refers to as the action of signing and publishing a new block in the chain. Bakers need at least 8,000 XTZ to qualify as a delegate, and having additional delegated stake increases their chances of being selected as a Baker or Endorser.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of each cycle (4096 blocks), the Bakers for each block are randomly selected and published. Bakers earn a block reward of 40 XTZ for baking a block.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the Baker, 32 Endorsers are randomly selected to verify the last block that was baked. Endorsers receive 1.25 XTZ for each block they endorse.\r\n\r\nBlock Rewards \u0026 Inflation\r\nBlock rewards are funded by protocol defined inflation. Rewards are calibrated so that the number of XTZ tokens grows at roughly 5.5% per year. If 100% of Tezos tokens are delegated, the annualized yield will be 5.5%. As of May 2021, approximately 78.8% of Tezos tokens have been delegated, including the 10% owned by the Tezos Foundation, so the annualized yield is roughly 5.8%.\r\n\r\nTo ensure Bakers and Endorsers act honestly, they are required to post a security deposit for each block they Bake or Endorse. They forfeit this deposit in the event of malicious activity, such as double baking or double endorsing a block.\r\n\r\nIn 2018, Tezos successfully launched their main network after delaying the launch due to corporate governance disputes. The Tezos foundation planned to transition the network to a mainnet, or a more complete version. The foundation has also raised $232 million in July 2017 to build the network and issue a new type of cryptocurrency to its backers in one of the largest- ever initial coin offerings. The founders have also made it clear in their blog that the network is using a new blockchain technology hence unexpected issues may still occur affecting the network.\r\n\r\nCheck out \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.coinbureau.com/review/tezos-xtz/\u0022\u003ECoinBureau\u003C/a\u003E for the complete review of Tezos.",

    "Description": "Verge coin started its cryptocurrency journey in 2014, going by the name of DogecoinDark. The reason it was created was to create a truly private cryptocurrency. The founder of Verge felt that \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\u0022\u003EBitcoin\u003C/a\u003E wasn\u2019t anonymous, so he decided to build a new blockchain where transactions could not be traced. Verge uses multiple anonymity-centric networks such as TOR and I2P. The IP addresses of the users are fully obfuscated. The Core QT wallet has built-in TOR integration as well as SSL encryption which adds an extra level of security.\r\n\r\nVerge is an open source project with an active team of developers from all over the world. The development team is always in close contact with the community. Verge is not a private company funded through an ICO or premining. Wraith Protocol is a technology upgrade package that enables our users to be able to send and receive payments privately across our blockchain by enabling stealth addressing services.   Additionally this update removes our QT wallet users off of clearnet and migrates everyone to SSL enabled Tor.\r\n\r\nVerge focuses on security and maintaining user anonymity just like \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/monero\u0022\u003EMonero\u003C/a\u003E; so that is its latent upside. Many investors are also applauding its unique technology. Having been improved and integrated with the Wraith Protocol technology, verge users are now able to effortlessly switch between private and public ledgers on the Verge blockchain.\r\n\r\nBefore this, private and public ledgers were mutually selected, meaning that they could not co-exist on a very similar blockchain. But investors are today free to use whatever ledger they want. A good example was when Wraith Protocol switched ON \u2013 one will not be able to view the transaction data, not even via the blockchain explorer. Additionally, Verge makes obscure the IP addresses in both instances. When coupled with Wraith Protocol Verge certainly becomes the only undetectable cryptocurrency.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, transaction speed on Verge is light speed at 5 seconds only, using Simple Payment Verification technology. Verge also maintains a community feel since it\u2019s not a private company. Community members are responsible for the direction of its technology and where the coin heads next. It currently offers a number of secure mobile wallets, including the Tor Android Wallet, which offers mobile anonymity, another big plus over Bitcoin.\r\n\r\nVerges offers five different Proof-of-Work algorithms for mining. They include; Lyra2rev2, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.coingecko.com/en?hashing_algorithm=Scrypt\u0026view=market\u0022\u003EScrypt\u003C/a\u003E, X17, blake2s and myr-groestl. Offering a choice of five different algorithms promotes inclusion, since a wider variety of users will now have an opportunity to not only mine but influence the network. Should one algorithm demand greater mining resources, users get an option of just switching to a different one.",

    "Description": "Founded in August 2017, ICON has spent many years fostering its L1 ecosystem and pushing for sustainable cross-chain development infrastructure. As many apps experience cross-chain difficulties today, ICON recognizes the frustration regarding the complexity involved with security, scaling and speed in cross-chain environments. Apps use ICON to operate cross-chain seamlessly, build momentum and gain a solid reputation. ICON\u0027s Cross-Chain Framework helps to simplify cross-chain development with its easy-to-use xCall General Message Passing and connections to secure bridging protocols. Visit the ICON Community website for an up to date overview of connected blockchains. Check out the documentation and see if your favorite application is compatible with the ICON Cross-Chain Framework! What Makes ICON Unique? The ICON Cross-Chain Framework consists of a robust L1 blockchain, xCall General Message Passing and a growing list of connected blockchains and integrated bridging protocols. ICON\u0027s native ICX coin fuels this interoperability by acting as the L1 gas token, xCall cross-chain fee token with associated applications. A sizeable percentage of all these fees collected in ICX are burned. Buying ICX (with fiat) is easy on big centralized exchanges, decentralized exchanges and even in-wallet.\u00A0\r\n\r\n",
